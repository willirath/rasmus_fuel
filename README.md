This package allows for estimating fuel consumption (taking into account ocean currents, waves and wind) for vessels.
It also allows to derive estimates of CO_2 emissions.

## Model parameters

In the model the convension of SI units for all parameters is implemented. Input parameters for the model are described in the table below.

| Parameter | Description , Units |
| --- | --- |
| Vessel design speed | maxium speed vessel reach at calm conditions [m/s] |
| Specific fuel consumption (SFOC)| specific fuel consumption, [kg/Wh]  |
| Number of operational engines | Vessel number of operational engines |
| Load per active engine | the torque output of an engine |
| Maximum continuous rating (MCR)| maximum power output of engine|
| Conversion factor of fuel to CO_2 | conversion factor from fuel to CO_2 mass [kg of fuel / kg CO_2]|

## Emission model description

For a single operational engine and auxiliary engine power, the total fuel consumption is estimated according to (see [1]):

$Fuel\_Consumption = (CRScor \cdot MCR \cdot Engine\_Power \cdot Load\_Factor + FCaux) \cdot SFOC / 3600$

where $CRScor$ is a correction reduced speed factor evaluated as given:

$CRScor = ((V\_{actual}/V\_{design}) ^ 3 + 0.2) / 1.2,$

$V\_{actual}$ and $V\_{design}$ are vessel speeds operational and design.

The term $FCaux$ is an auxiliary engine power estimated according to relationship:

$FCaux = Auxiliary\_Engine_Power \cdot Load\_Factor$,

for simplicity in the model $FCaux = 0.63 \cdot Engine\_Power$

For a case when a number of operational engines of vessel > 1 the formula for a fuel consumption recasts to [1]:

$Fuel\_Consumption = (CRScor \cdot Number\_Active\_Engines \cdot fMCR \cdot Engine\_Power \cdot Load\_Factor + FCaux) \cdot SFOC / 3600$

where $fMCR$ is a fraction of maximum continuous rating which is equal to:

$fMCR = Number\_Operational\_Engines / Number\_Active_Engines \cdot CRScor \cdot MCR$

To estimate the number of active engines, the following relationship is used:

$Number\_Active\_Engines = {\rm min}(Engines\_Operational, {\rm ceil}(CRScor \cdot Engines\_Operational \cdot MCR))$

As for total fuel-based CO_2 emission per a single voyage the formula is used:

$Emission = Conversion\_Factor\_Fuel\_toCO2 \cdot Fuel\_Consumption \cdot Sailing\_Time,$

where $Sailing\_Time$ is a single voyage time.
