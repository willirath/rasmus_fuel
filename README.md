The model estimates at first step a fuel consumption and at seconds step a fuel-based CO_2 emission for a slow-speed (<400 rotation per minute (RPM)) container ships with a diesel engine 
that runs on marine diesel oil (MDO). Total engine fuel consumption and emission are calculated for diesel engine type MAN-B&W with parameters described below. 

### Model parameters

In the model the convension of SI units for all parameters is implemented. Input parameters for the model are described in the table below. 

| Parameter | Description , Units | 
| --- | --- |
| Vessel design speed | maxium speed vessel reach at calm conditions [m/s] |
| Specific fuel consumption (SFOC)| specific fuel consumption, [kg/Wh]  |
| Number of operational engines | Vessel number of operational engines |
| Load per active engine | the torque output of an engine |
| Maximum continuous rating (MCR)| maximum power output of engine|
| Conversion factor of fuel to CO_2 | conversion factor from fuel to CO_2 mass [kg of fuel / kg CO_2]| 



### Emission model description

Depending on number of oepartional engines two alternative formulas for fuel consumption is implemented.
To estimate a total fuel consumption with a single operational engine and auxiliary engine power the formulas is used:

**Fuel_Consumption = (CRScor * MCR * Engine_Power  * Load_Factor + FCaux)* SFOC * /3600 **     

where **CRScor** is a correction reduced speed factor evaluated as given:

**CRScor = ((V_{actual}/V_{design}) ^ 3 + 0.2) / 1.2, **

**V_{actual}**  and **V_{design}** are vessel speeds operational and design. 

The term **FCaux** is an auxiliary engine power estimated according to relationship:

**FCaux = Auxiliary_Engine_Power * Load_Factor**,

for simplicity in the model **FCaux = 0.63 * Engine_Power**

For a case when a number of operational engines of vessel > 1 the formula for a fuel consumption recasts to:

**Fuel_Consumption = (CRScor * Number_Active_Engines * fMCR * Engine_Power  * Load_Factor + FCaux)* SFOC * /3600 ** 

where **fMCR** is a fraction of maximum continuous rating which is equal to:

**fMCR = Number_Operational_Engines / Number_Active_Engines * CRScor * MCR**

To calculated a number of active engines the relationship is used:

**Number_Active_Engines = min(Engines_Operational, round(CRScor * Engines_Operational * MCR)+1) **

As for total fuel-based CO_2 emission per a single voyage the formula is used: 

**Emission = Conversion_Factor_Fuel_toCO2 * Fuel_Consumption * Sailing_Time, **   

where **Sailing_Time** is a single voyage time.
